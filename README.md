# Podcast in a Year Player
This Kotlin program loads podcast data from the Fr. Mike Schmitz Bible and Catechism in a year podcasts and plays them in mpv. 

This program requires you to have [mpv](https://mpv.io/installation)  installed

Get started: 
```
git clone https://github.com/jforseth210/podcastinayearplayer
cd podcasinayearplayer
./gradlew run
```

You'll be prompted to select a show and an episode, and then it will play the requested episode.
