# Podcast in a Year Player
This Kotlin program loads podcast data from the Fr. Mike Schmitz Bible and Catechism in a year podcasts and plays them in mpv. 

This program requires you to have [mpv](https://mpv.io/installation)  installed.

Get started: 
```
git clone https://github.com/jforseth210/podcastinayearplayer
```

If you have IntelliJ IDEA installed, click File > Open, navigate to the installed directory, select app, trust project, and click the green play button in the top right. 
You can also use gradle to run it on the command-line.
